    <h1>RadhaKrishna</h1>
    <p>RadhaKrishna refers to the divine love and spiritual union of Radha and Krishna, two of the most revered figures in Hinduism. Their relationship is symbolic of the eternal bond between the human soul and the divine.

🕉️ Who is Krishna?
Krishna is one of the most beloved and widely worshipped deities in Hinduism, considered the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu. He is known for:

His childhood mischief and miracles in Vrindavan

Playing the flute and enchanting the gopis (cowherd girls)

His divine wisdom in the Bhagavad Gita, a key part of the epic Mahabharata

Being the supreme deity in Vaishnavism

🌺 Who is Radha?
Radha is considered Krishna's eternal consort and the personification of devotion (bhakti). Though not mentioned prominently in early scriptures like the Mahabharata, her role gained prominence in later devotional literature such as:

The Bhagavata Purana

Jayadeva’s Gita Govinda

Various works of Vaishnava poets and saints

💖 Radha-Krishna Love Story
Their love is spiritual, not physical. Key points:

Radha and Krishna’s love is seen as the highest form of devotion and union with God

Radha represents the soul (jeevatma), and Krishna the divine (paramatma)

Though they never married, their bond is considered transcendental and eternal

Their story is often used in Bhakti movements to express unconditional love and surrender to God

🎨 Cultural and Artistic Influence
Radha and Krishna's relationship has inspired:

Art: Miniature paintings, murals, and temple sculptures

Music and dance: Classical forms like Odissi and Kathak

Literature: Poems and bhajans by Meera Bai, Surdas, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and others

TV and movies: Popular shows like RadhaKrishn depict their divine tale

🛕 Worship and Temples
Worshipped together in temples, especially in Vrindavan and Barsana (Radha’s birthplace)

Major festivals: Janmashtami (Krishna’s birthday) and Radhashtami (Radha’s birthday)

The ISKCON movement often places great emphasis on Radha-Krishna devotion
